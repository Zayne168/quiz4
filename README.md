# argumnets.py:
#  -spelled that way because you told us to
#  -takes in a string, int, and float and parses them.
# abc_class.py:
#  -uses abstract methods
#  -initializes itself with a given number
#  - SimpleMath() class will either add or subtract data from self depending on the method used
#  - AdjustOne() class will replace self with **data** plus one or minus one (this method acts as a data++ or data-- function #      set like in C++)
# protocol.py:
#  -same as abc_class but uses protocols
# dataclass.py:
#  -fish class
#    -species,price($),weight(lbs)
#    -can print the fish object
# dataclass_ext.py
#    -prints the fish object from the fish point of view.
# property.py
#    -cars class
#    -uses @property to make a formatted way to print the year, make, and model of car.
# no_property.py
